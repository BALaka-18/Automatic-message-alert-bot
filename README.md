Flow of the bot :

1. It is console based. So the user will be asked to enter the number of people they want to alert via Whatsapp.

2. Next, they have to provide the chat head names. Make sure the chat heads are unarchived.

3. Then the user is prompted to enter message he/she wants to send out as warning.

4. The bot automates the message sending process.
